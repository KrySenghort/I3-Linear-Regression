    "Ridge Regression, also known as L2 regularization, is another linear regression regularization technique used to prevent overfitting and handle multicollinearity (high correlation between independent variables) by adding an L2 penalty term to the linear regression equation. Like Lasso, Ridge Regression modifies the standard linear regression cost function by adding a penalty term, but in this case, the penalty is based on the square of the coefficients instead of their absolute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The regularized linear regression equation using Ridge Regression can be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + ... + b_nx_n + ε = b_0 + Σ_{k=1}^{n}(b_kx_k) +  ε $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The regularization term in Ridge Regression is added to the standard least squares loss function (the sum of squared errors) and is proportional to the squared values of the coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ Loss = Σ(Squared Errors) + λΣ(b_i^2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- ##### $ y $ is the dependent variable (the predicted value).\n",
    "- ##### $ x_1, x_2, ..., x_n $ are the independent variables (input features).\n",
    "- ##### $ b_0, b_1, b_2, ...,$ b_n are the coefficients.\n",
    "- ##### $ ε $ represents the error term, accounting for the variability not explained by the model.\n",
    "- ##### $ λ $ (lambda) is the regularization parameter, which controls the strength of the penalty. A larger λ value leads to greater shrinkage of coefficients, helping to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ridge penalty has the effect of regularizing the model by making the coefficients smaller. Unlike Lasso, which can drive some coefficients exactly to zero and perform feature selection, Ridge Regression can only shrink the coefficients towards zero but not exactly zero. As a result, Ridge Regression tends to retain all features but reduce their impact on the model, making it more suitable when you believe that most of the features are relevant but may be subject to multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression is beneficial when dealing with datasets that have a large number of potentially correlated features, as it helps to stabilize the model and improve its generalization performance. By introducing regularization, Ridge Regression can also help to mitigate the problem of overfitting, which can occur when the model becomes too complex and fits noise in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimal coefficients and the regularization parameter λ, an optimization algorithm is used, typically involving techniques like gradient descent or closed-form solutions. These algorithms minimize the Ridge loss function, striking a balance between minimizing the sum of squared errors and penalizing the size of the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression has widespread applications in various fields, including machine learning, statistics, finance, and engineering, among others. It is a valuable tool for improving the stability and generalization of linear regression models in situations where multicollinearity is a concern."
